# A comprehensive CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions for a Node.js application with testing and deployment. I'll create both the sample application and the CI/CD configuration.

## Here's what each part does:

### Sample Application (app.js):

Simple Express.js application with two endpoints
Health check endpoint
Error handling middleware
Proper separation of concerns


### Tests (app.test.js):

Uses Jest and Supertest for API testing
Tests both endpoints
Verifies response structure and status codes


### Package Configuration (package.json):

Defines all necessary dependencies
Includes scripts for testing, linting, and building
Sets up development dependencies for testing


### GitHub Actions Workflow (ci.yml):

Triggers on push to main and pull requests
Tests on multiple Node.js versions
Includes steps for:

Dependency installation
Linting
Testing with coverage
Building
Optional deployment step
