# GitHub Actions - High-Level Design (HLD) Overview
GitHub Actions is a CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) automation tool that enables developers to automate workflows, run tests, and deploy applications directly from a GitHub repository. It works by defining workflows using YAML files that get triggered by events such as pushes, pull requests, and schedule-based executions.
